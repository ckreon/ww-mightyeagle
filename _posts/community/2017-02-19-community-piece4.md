Lt. Karl 'Helo' Agathon: That's my Raptor wranglers, always looking for new and interesting ways to get killed.

Commander William Adama: There's a reason you separate military and the police. One fights the enemies of the state, the other serves and protects the people. When the military becomes both, then the enemies of the state tend to become the people.

Number Six: Life has a melody, Gaius. A rhythm of notes which become your existence once played in harmony with God's plan.

Commander William Adama: Sometimes, you have to roll a hard six.

Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: [after Starbuck has to plan a vital mission] I never wanted this kind of responsibility.  Commander William Adama: The Cylons never asked us what we wanted. Welcome to the big leagues.

Commander William Adama: There's a reason you separate military and the police. One fights the enemies of the state, the other serves and protects the people. When the military becomes both, then the enemies of the state tend to become the people.

Brother Cavil: In all your travels, have you ever seen a star go supernova?  Ellen Tigh: No.  Brother Cavil: No? Well, I have. I saw a star explode and send out the building blocks of the Universe. Other stars, other planets and eventually other life. A supernova! Creation itself! I was there. I wanted to see it and be part of the moment. And you know how I perceived one of the most glorious events in the universe? With these ridiculous gelatinous orbs in my skull! With eyes designed to perceive only a tiny fraction of the EM spectrum. With ears designed only to hear vibrations in the air.

Ellen Tigh: The five of us designed you to be as human as possible.  Brother Cavil: I don't want to be human! I want to see gamma rays! I want to hear X-rays! And I want to - I want to smell dark matter! Do you see the absurdity of what I am? I can't even express these things properly because I have to - I have to conceptualize complex ideas in this stupid limiting spoken language! But I know I want to reach out with something other than these prehensile paws! And feel the wind of a supernova flowing over me! I'm a machine! And I can know much more! I can experience so much more. But I'm trapped in this absurd body! And why? Because my five creators thought that God wanted it that way!

Doctor Gaius Baltar: You'll forgive me, Madam President, if I don't wish to be executed based solely on your... gut feeling.

Admiral Helena Cain: [Cain has been beating, raping and torturing her own copy of Number Six, who now has a gun to her head] Frack you.  Number Six: You're not my type.  [shoots Cain]

Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: [Starbuck had sex with Baltar] I don't owe you anything.  Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: No, you don't owe me anything 'cause I'm just a C.A.G., and you're just a pilot!  Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: Right.  Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: Pilot who can't keep her pants on.  Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: Right.  Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: Oh, it is just like old times, Kara. Like when you got drunk and you couldn't keep your hands off that major from wherever...  [Starbuck punches Apollo, and Apollo instantly punches her right back]
