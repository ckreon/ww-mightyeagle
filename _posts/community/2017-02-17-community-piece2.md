President Laura Roslin: [about Commander Adama] Maybe if he's more comfortable he'll be a little easier to deal with.  Billy Keikeya: That's smart.  President Laura Roslin: No, it's not smart. It's politics.

Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: So... um... that bum knee of yours is looking pretty good. And the other one's not too bad either.  Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: Lee, if you want to ask me to dance, just ask.  Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: You want to dance?  Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: Me in a dress is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: [Starbuck had sex with Baltar] I don't owe you anything.  Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: No, you don't owe me anything 'cause I'm just a C.A.G., and you're just a pilot!  Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: Right.  Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: Pilot who can't keep her pants on.  Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: Right.  Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: Oh, it is just like old times, Kara. Like when you got drunk and you couldn't keep your hands off that major from wherever...  [Starbuck punches Apollo, and Apollo instantly punches her right back]

Crewman Specialist Cally: [analyzing the bio-mechanical Cylon Raider captured by Starbuck, Tyrol crawls inside the Raider with a flashlight while Cally reads him Starbuck's notes] Starbuck's notes on the Cylon Raider are a mess! She said the engine power-up sequence began... "By squeezing something that looks like a red ligament with blue veins on the right side... coming out of a sack of gooey fluid... shaped like a dog".  Chief Petty Officer Tyrol: Are you kidding me? This whole thing is a bunch of veins and ligaments and sacks of goo!  Crewman Specialist Cally: "... Squeeze the ligament with your hand, while you slide your weight on your left hip, into the lymphatic sack... "  Chief Petty Officer Tyrol: Well, that's just stupid!  Crewman Specialist Cally: [Col. Tigh arrives] Oh, afternoon sir.  Col. Saul Tigh: Specialist. Chief's inside?  Crewman Specialist Cally: Yeah.  Col. Saul Tigh: Chief?  Chief Petty Officer Tyrol: Yes, sir?  Col. Saul Tigh: How's it coming in there?  Chief Petty Officer Tyrol: Ah, I'm getting there, sir. Haven't quite figured out all the tricks but I'm getting there.

Romo Lampkin: I understand that you had a romantic relationship with my client.  Number Six: Gaius Baltar is a brilliant, gifted human being. In the time I've known him, he's made a sport out of mendacity and deception. He is narcissistic, feckless, self-centered, and vain. I'm the one who should have stabbed him.  President Laura Roslin: Things are looking up.

Commander William Adama: [President Roslin is bedridden, dying of cancer, and coughing profusely] What can I get you?  President Laura Roslin: [sarcastically] A new body. Perhaps, one of those young Cylon models from the Resurrection Ship.  Commander William Adama: I can't see you as a blonde.  President Laura Roslin: You'd be surprised.  [laughs]

Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: I thought we were sparring.  Commander William Adama: That's why you don't win.

Various Characters: [Repeated throughout the series] Oh my Gods!

Crewman Specialist Cally: [analyzing the bio-mechanical Cylon Raider captured by Starbuck, Tyrol crawls inside the Raider with a flashlight while Cally reads him Starbuck's notes] Starbuck's notes on the Cylon Raider are a mess!

Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: [before hitting an assailant over the head with a beer bottle] Were you looking for *this*?
