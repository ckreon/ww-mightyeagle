Doctor Gaius Baltar: You'll forgive me, Madam President, if I don't wish to be executed based solely on your... gut feeling.

Chief Petty Officer Tyrol: [Socinus has been mortally injured and Tyrol has to euthanize him with an overdose of morphine] Hey, buddy. It's the Chief. How you doing?  Crewman Specialist Socinus: [wheezing] What's going on Chief?  Chief Petty Officer Tyrol: Oh, you know... listening to the birds. I uh... I got a little something for the pain...  [injects Socinus with the morphine overdose]  Chief Petty Officer Tyrol: Good news, buddy. They got a rescue party here. Raptor's just landed. We're going to put you on it and take you back to Galactica, okay?  Crewman Specialist Socinus: We're going home?  Chief Petty Officer Tyrol: Yeah. Going home.  [tears well up in his eyes]  Chief Petty Officer Tyrol: [Socinus dies]

[when Starbuck has landed in the Cylon ship]  Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: Boy, when you take a souvenir, you don't screw around.
Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: [in a deleted scene after Laura Roslin asked him if what she did was a mistake] I believe that it is never a mistake to follow your heart.

Petty Officer 2nd Dualla: [after being taken hostage while trying to negotiate with prisoners] I don't even know how I came into this detail.  Billy Keikeya: The president thought you might be valuable.  Petty Officer 2nd Dualla: The president doesn't know who I am.  Billy Keikeya: I told her. Sorry.  Petty Officer 2nd Dualla: [sarcastically] On the other hand, it is nice to get out of the CIC. Break up the day, move around, meet new people.

Chief Petty Officer Tyrol: [Socinus has been mortally injured and Tyrol has to euthanize him with an overdose of morphine] Hey, buddy. It's the Chief. How you doing?  Crewman Specialist Socinus: [wheezing] What's going on Chief?  Chief Petty Officer Tyrol: Oh, you know... listening to the birds. I uh... I got a little something for the pain...

Commander William Adama: [giving a speech in the Hanger Deck] We have struggled since the attacks... trying to rely on one another. Our strength and our only hope as a people, is to remain undivided. We haven't always done all we could to insure that. Many people believe that the scriptures, the letters from the gods, will lead us to salvation. Maybe they will. But the gods shall lift those who lift each other." And so, to lift all of us, let me present once again the president of the colonies, Laura Roslin.  [many members of the audience applaud but some do not. Adama walks to the crowd and begins to clap in rhythm. The crowd slowly catches on and eventually the entire Hanger Deck is applauding in rhythm as a sign of respect for the reinstated president]
Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: So... um... that bum knee of yours is looking pretty good. And the other one's not too bad either.  Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: Lee, if you want to ask me to dance, just ask.  Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: You want to dance?  Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: Me in a dress is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Number Six: Life has a melody, Gaius. A rhythm of notes which become your existence once played in harmony with God's plan.
