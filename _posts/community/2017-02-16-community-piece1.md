Lt. Karl 'Helo' Agathon: That's my Raptor wranglers, always looking for new and interesting ways to get killed.

Commander William Adama: [President Roslin is bedridden, dying of cancer, and coughing profusely] What can I get you?  President Laura Roslin: [sarcastically] A new body. Perhaps, one of those young Cylon models from the Resurrection Ship.  Commander William Adama: I can't see you as a blonde.  President Laura Roslin: You'd be surprised.  [laughs]

Doctor Gaius Baltar: [after finding out that he's being forced into becoming a politician while testing blood samples] Politics is the only thing more boring than blood samples.

Brother Cavil: In all your travels, have you ever seen a star go supernova?  Ellen Tigh: No.  Brother Cavil: No? Well, I have. I saw a star explode and send out the building blocks of the Universe. Other stars, other planets and eventually other life. A supernova! Creation itself! I was there. I wanted to see it and be part of the moment. And you know how I perceived one of the most glorious events in the universe? With these ridiculous gelatinous orbs in my skull! With eyes designed to perceive only a tiny fraction of the EM spectrum. With ears designed only to hear vibrations in the air.

Ellen Tigh: The five of us designed you to be as human as possible.

Brother Cavil: I don't want to be human! I want to see gamma rays! I want to hear X-rays! And I want to - I want to smell dark matter! Do you see the absurdity of what I am? I can't even express these things properly because I have to - I have to conceptualize complex ideas in this stupid limiting spoken language! But I know I want to reach out with something other than these prehensile paws! And feel the wind of a supernova flowing over me! I'm a machine! And I can know much more! I can experience so much more. But I'm trapped in this absurd body! And why? Because my five creators thought that God wanted it that way!

Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: [after Starbuck has to plan a vital mission] I never wanted this kind of responsibility.  Commander William Adama: The Cylons never asked us what we wanted. Welcome to the big leagues.

Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: [before hitting an assailant over the head with a beer bottle] Were you looking for *this*?

Commander William Adama: Keep jumping.
Commander William Adama: Keep jumping.

Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: [before hitting an assailant over the head with a beer bottle] Were you looking for *this*?

Doctor Gaius Baltar: [after Baltar walks in on Boomer trying to commit suicide] Sometimes we must embrace that which opens up to us.  Lt. Sharon 'Boomer' Valerii: Embrace?  Doctor Gaius Baltar: Life can be a curse, as well as a blessing. You will believe me when I say that there are far worse things than death in this world.  Lt. Sharon 'Boomer' Valerii: So what you're saying is...  Doctor Gaius Baltar: No, no. What I'm saying means nothing. Listen to your heart. Do that which you truly believe to be right.  [he kisses her on the forehead and walks out of the room, while he's walking down the hall he hears a gun fire]
