The Operative: It's worse than you know.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: It usually is. Young River: People don't like to be meddled with. We tell them what to do, what to think, don't run, don't walk. We're in their homes and in their heads and we haven't the right. We're meddlesome.

River Tam: [seeing visions of dead bodies on Miranda] Run-tse duh shang-dee, ching dai-wuhtzo... make them stop! They're everywhere. Every city, every... every house, every room; they're all inside me! I can hear them all and they're saying... NOTHING! GET UP! Please, get up! Wuo-shang mayer, maysheen byen shr-to. Please God, make me a stone.

Zoe: [after breaking into a practically empty bank safe]  Zoe: At last, we can retire and give up this life of crime.

Zoe: Do you know what the definition of a hero is? Someone who gets other people killed. You can look it up later.

Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Come a day there won't be room for naughty men like us to slip about at all. This job goes south, there well may not be another. So here is us, on the raggedy edge. Don't push me, and I won't push you. Dong le ma?

The Operative: Define "disappeared".

Mr. Universe: I cried like a baby, a hungry, angry baby.

[chased by a Reaver aircraft]  Jayne Cobb: How come they ain't blowin' us out the air?  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: They wanna run us down. The up-close kill.  River Tam: They want us alive when they eat us.

Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Ah, hell, Shepherd, I ain't looking for help from on high. That's a long wait for a train don't come.  Shepherd Book: Why when I talk about belief, why do you always assume I'm talking about God?
