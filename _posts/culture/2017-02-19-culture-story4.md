Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: This is exactly what I didn't want. I wanted simple, I wanted in-and-out, I wanted easy money.  Zoe: Things always get a little more complicated, don't they sir?  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Once, just once, I want things to go according to the gorram plan!

[opening narration for episodes: Safe, Ariel, War Stories, Heart of Gold]  Mal: Here's how it is: The Earth got used up, so we moved out and terraformed a whole new galaxy of Earths. Some rich and flush with the new technologies, some not so much. The Central Planets, thems formed the Alliance, waged war to bring everyone under their rule; a few idiots tried to fight it, among them myself. I'm Malcolm Reynolds, captain of Serenity. She's a transport ship; Firefly class. Got a good crew: fighters, pilot, mechanic. We even picked up a preacher for some reason, and a bona fide companion. There's a doctor, too, took his genius sister outta some Alliance camp, so they're keepin' a low profile. You understand. You got a job, we can do it, don't much care what it is.

Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: [the Operative has politely asked Mal to return River] You have to open with payment.  The Operative: That is a trap. I offer money, you'll play the man of honor and take umbrage; I ask you to do what is right and you'll play the brigand. I have no stomach for games.

Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Bit of a rockety ride. Nothing to worry about.  Dr. Simon Tam: I'm not worried.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: [mocking Simon's seriousness] Fear's nothing to be ashamed of, Doctor.  Dr. Simon Tam: This isn't fear. This is anger.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Well, kinda hard to tell one from t'other, face like yours.  Dr. Simon Tam: Yes, well, I imagine if it were fear, my eyes would be wider.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: I'll look for that next time.

[after the hovercraft makes a crash landing in the hanger of Serenity. Simon runs to his sister]  Dr. Simon Tam: River?  River Tam: I swallowed a bug.
Zoe: [after breaking into a practically empty bank safe]  Zoe: At last, we can retire and give up this life of crime.

Mr. Universe: You can't stop the signal, Mal. Everything goes somewhere, and I go everywhere.
