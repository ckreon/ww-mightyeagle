The Operative: You're fighting a war you've already lost.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Yeah, well, I'm known for that. The Operative: I want to resolve this like civilized men. I'm not threatening you. I'm unarmed.

Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Good.  [pulls gun and shoots Operative in the chest, knocking him into the wall, grabs Inara and gets ready to leave]  The Operative: [grabs Mal from behind] I am, however, wearing full body armor. I am not a moron!

Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Doctor, I'm takin' your sister under my protection here. If anything happens to her, anything at all, I swear to you, I will get very choked up. Honestly, there could be tears.

[to Simon]  Kaylee Frye: Don't pay anybody in advance. And don't ride in anything with a Capissen 38 engine, they fall right out of the sky.

Zoe: It's a fair bet the Alliance knows about Mr. Universe. They're gonna see this coming.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: No. They're not going to see this coming.
Kaylee Frye: If you had a care for anybody's heart...  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: You knew he was gonna leave. We never been nothing but a way station to those two. And how the hell do you know what he feels? He's got River to worry on, but he still could've shown you. If I truly wanted someone bad enough, wouldn't be a thing in the 'verse that could stop me from going to her.  Kaylee Frye: [nods disbelievingly] Tell that to Inara!

Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: So I'm noticing. Is there a problem we don't know of?  [pause]  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: You got a sweet take kissing your foot. How about you take your 25% and we can talk about the next job?  Fanty: Well our end is forty, precious.  Jayne Cobb: My muscular buttocks it's forty.

Inara Serra: Mal, what are you doing here?  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: You invited me.  Inara Serra: I never thought for a second you'd be stupid enough to come!  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Well that makes you a tease.

Kaylee Frye: Have faith, Captain!  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Not today.

Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Kaylee, what in the sphincter of hell are you playing at? We got the primary buffer panel coming right...  Kaylee Frye: Everything's shiny, Cap'n. Not to fret.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: You told me those entry couplings would hold for another week!  Kaylee Frye: That was six months ago, Cap'n.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: My ship don't crash. If she crashes, you crashed her.
