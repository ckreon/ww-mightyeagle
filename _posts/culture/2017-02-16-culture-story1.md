Dr. Simon Tam: Am I talking to Miranda now?  [River makes a face]  Dr. Simon Tam: No. Not right. Fanty: [watching River fighting in a bar] Do you know that girl?  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: I really don't.

Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Ah, hell, Shepherd, I ain't looking for help from on high. That's a long wait for a train don't come.  Shepherd Book: Why when I talk about belief, why do you always assume I'm talking about God?

Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: This is how it is. Anybody doesn't wanna fly with me any more, this is your port of harbor. There's a lot of fine ways to die. I ain't waiting for the Alliance to choose mine.  [shoots Alliance soldier crawling from wreckage]  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: I mean to confound these bungers. Take my shot at getting to Miranda. Maybe find something I can use to get clear of this. So I hear a word out of any of you that ain't helping me out or taking your leave, I will shoot you down. Get to work!

Mr. Universe: You guys always bring me the very best violence.

Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: I am a leaf on the wind - watch how I soar.

Mr. Universe: From here to the eyes and the ears of the 'Verse, that's my motto, or it might be if I start having a motto.

Jayne Cobb: I won't get et! You shoot me if they take me!  [Mal aims pistol squarely at Jayne]  Jayne Cobb: Well, don't shoot me first!

Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: [First lines, camera pans around Serenity in re-entry and a panel flies off the nose] What aws that?  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: Did you see that?  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Was that the primary buffer panel?  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: It did seem to resemble...  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Did the primary buffer panel just fall off my gorram ship for no apparent reason?  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: [Checks his instruments] Looks like.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: I thought Kaylee checked the entry couplings. I've a very clear recollection of it.  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: Well, if she doesn't get us some extra flow from the engine room to offset the burn-through, this landing is gonna get pretty interesting.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Define "interesting."  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: [Deadpan] Oh God, oh God, we're all gonna die.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: [Grabs PA microphone] This is the captain. We're having a little problem with our entry sequence, so we may experience some slight turbulence and then... explode.  [Hangs up microphone]  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Can you shave the vector?  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: I'm doing it, it's not enough.  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Well, just get us on the ground.  Hoban 'Wash' Washburn: That part'll happen pretty definitely.

Kaylee Frye: Have faith, Captain!  Capt. Malcolm Reynolds: Not today.
